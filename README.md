# README #

GitHub-Pages-Preview is a Node.js replacement for Jekyll sites, allowing you to build your site, as-is, without needing to install Ruby or Python. [The story behind the original version, JekyllJS](http://divillysausages.com/2016/01/24/leaving-jekyll-behind/).

## Features ##

- No need to convert your site - liquid markup is handled using [liquid-node](https://github.com/sirlantis/liquid-node)
- Near identical output (see *Differences* below)
- Can optionally serve your site (including 404 page), so you can see your changes immediately
- Bonus liquid templates for generating a tags page, an archive page, and a RSS feed (found in the *bonus/* folder)
- It's very simple, so I'm having a hard time coming up with a fifth feature

## Differences ##

- **Code highlighting**: Jekyll uses Pygments or Rouge for code highlighting, while GitHub-Pages-Preview uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). Your code still gets highlighted, just the output will be different
- **Dates**: Dates in JavaScript handle [Romance Daylight Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time), meaning that if you're in Europe, any dates between the end of March to the end of October will have an extra hour in the output, i.e. `new Date( "2016-04-01 00:00:00 +0100" )` will print as `Fri Apr 01 2016 01:00:00 GMT+0200 (Romance Daylight Time)`. This may or may not be a problem for you, depending on how you use dates in your site
- **Categories**: GitHub-Pages-Preview doesn't support them, as I don't use them in my site. If there's a need, however, that can be changed
- **Include variables**: Assigning [variables for the `{% include %}` tag](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes) isn't supported. If you need support for tokens (for dynamic includes), you need to apply the patch listed below
- **Null `{% if %}` checks**: If you check for null via `{% if someVar == null %}`, you'll need to change it to `{% if someVar == undefined %}` or just simply `{% if someVar %}`

## Patches ##

Liquid-node doesn't currently support tokens in the `{% include %}` tag, so if it's something you need, you can apply the quick patch fix found in *include.js* in the *patches/* directory. Just copy the file to the *node_modules/liquid-node/lib/liquid/tags/* folder after you've installed your dependencies.

When I added Markdown support using the [marked node.js library](https://github.com/chjj/marked) I found that it was escaping all quotes for all reasons, including normal text ("don't", "can't", "I'm", etc). I don't particularly like this behaviour (it's still valid HTML though), so I added a fix around it. Just replace the *marked.js* file in the *patches/* directory with the one in the *node_modules/marked/lib/* folder if you want to do the same.

## Config ##

GitHub-Pages-Preview comes with a simple config file, `config/default.yaml`, meaning you can change a few things without having to re-compile the project. It looks like this:

```yaml
log:
  level: info
src:
  '404': /404/
  path: /home/mike/nodejs/mermade.github.io/
meta:
  keywords: 'default,keywords,here'
  description: default description
highlight:
  parentClassName: highlight
  shouldWrap: true
server:
  port: 4000
```

which translates as:

- `log.level`: the level used by [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan), the logger used by GitHub-Pages-Preview
- `src.path`: the full path to the folder containing your Jekyll site (i.e. where *_layouts/* and *_posts/* live)
- `src.404`: the path for the file to serve as the 404 page, if you have one
- `meta.keywords`: the default meta keywords to add to each page if the page doesn't specify any. Set to null or leave out to ignore this
- `meta.description`: the default meta description to add to each page if the page doesn't specify one. If null or left out, then the description in *_config.yml* will be used (if set)
- `opengraph.fb:admins`: the ID of the Facebook user that you want to associate as the admin of the page. If null, then it's not added to the page
- `opengraph.og:type`: the default type for each page, unless overwritten. If null and not overwritten, then it's not added to the page
- `opengraph.og:image`: the image to use as the default OpenGraph share. If null and not overwritten, then it's not added to the page
- `highlight.parentClassname`: the classname for the parent node for highlighted code. Use `highlight` to keep with the Jekyll generated code, or `hljs` to use the highlight.js version
- `highlight.shouldWrap`: Should we wrap our generated code in a div? Use `true` to keep with the Jekyll generated code, or `false` to use the highlight.js version (in which case the `highlight.parentClassname` will be applied to the code tag
- `server.port`: the port to use when serving the site

NOTE: other basic OpenGraph tags can be auto generated:

- `og:title`: the post title, or the site title if there isn't a post one: `<meta property="og:title" content="{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }}{% else %}{{ site.title }}{% endif %}" />`
- `og:site_name`: taken from *_config.yml*: `<meta property="og:site_name" content="{{ site.title }}"/>`
- `og:url`: the full canonical url of the page; `<meta property="og:url" content="{{ page.url | replace:'index.html','' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />`

## Running GitHub-Pages-Preview ##

To compile your site, make sure the config in `config/default.yaml` is up to date, then open a command line and type:

`./ghpp`

If you want GitHub-Pages-Preview to serve your site as well, use:

`./ghpp serve`

## Sample Post YAML FrontMatter ##

A quick idea of the frontmatter for a post, some of which would override the site defaults:

```yaml
---
date: 2016-04-23 17:19:00 +0100
layout: post
permalink: /intro/
title: "Intro"
meta:
  keywords: one, two, three, four
  description: This is the description for the intro doc
opengraph:
  fb:admins: 1234567
  og:type: website
  og:image: /img/open_graph2.png
  og:locale: en_GB
  og:video: "http://some_video.com"
tracking:
  fbpixel: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
---
```

where:

- `date`: the date the post was published
- `layout`: the layout to use for the post
- `permalink`: the permalink for the post
- `title`: the title for the post
- `meta.keywords`: keywords to use for the `<meta>` tag in the page head. If null, then the defaults from the config are used
- `meta.description`: the description to use for the `<meta>` tag in the page head. If null, then the default from the config is used
- `opengraph.fb:admins`: the ID of the Facebook user to set as the admin from the page. If null, then the default from the config is used
- `opengraph.og:type`: the type of the page for opengraph. If null, then the default from the config is used
- `opengraph.og:image`: the image to use for opengraph. If null, then the default from the config is used
- `og:locale`/`og:video`: any other opengraph tag will be added to the page automatically
- `tracking:fbpixel`: the ID of the Facebook tracking pixel that you want to add to the page

## Theme support

Check out GitHub pages themes into the `themes` directory.

You may need to add `{% endseo %}` tags until I can figure out how to create auto-closing tags in Liquid.

You can build the `scss` into plain `css` with the included `buildStyle` script.
