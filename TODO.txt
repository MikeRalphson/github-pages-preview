* Dates not saving right (applying the +0100 to the output - jekyll doesn't)
* CSS needs to be updated for the highlight.js code
* Have a server option that starts up a server
* Inline actionscript script tags need to be changed so they can be handled by highlightjs

========== DONE ==========
* Comments aren't included
* Files aren't included
* Including comments and files breaks because the {% include %} tag doesn't parse tokens
* Comments might not possibly work for the index file (check frontPagePost is undefined rather than null)
